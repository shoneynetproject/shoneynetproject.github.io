    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>The Spanish Honeynet Project is a non-profit research organization of security professionals dedicated to information security. We have no products, services or employees, and our research is done on a volunteer basis. It is our goal to learn the tools, tactics, and motives of the blackhat community and share these lessons learned. It is hoped that our research will benefit both its members and the security community. All of our work is <a href="http://opensource.org">OpenSource</a> and shared with the security community.</p>
<p>Our intend is to support the security community in any of the following ways:</p>
<h2>Raise Awareness</h2>
<p>To raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exists in the Internet today. We raise awareness by both demonstrating the vulnerability of real systems in the wild through the use of honeypots and by publicizing our investigations (and that of the Honeynet Project as a whole) through conferences and talks to Spanish-speaking technical audiences. The project members have participated in the FIST Conferences, and in technical courses in some of Spain’s universities (<abbr title="Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación">ETSIT</abbr>-<abbr title="Universidad Politécnica de Madrid">UPM</abbr>, and <abbr title="Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha ">UCLM</abbr>).</p>
<p>Other valuable means for raising awareness includes developing “Forensic Challenges”. The project members have participated in the organization of the Spanish Forensic Challenges in cooperation with other institutions interested in honeypots and forensics such as RedIris, and have also organized the <a href="http://old.honeynet.org/scans/scan32/">Scan of the Month Challenge #32</a> of the Honeynet Project.</p>
<h2>Teach and Inform</h2>
<p>For those in the community who are already aware and concerned, we hope to give you the information to better secure and defend your resources. Historically, intelligence about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. The Spanish Honeynet Project intends on providing additional interesting information. For example, their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system.</p>
<p>The Spanish Honeynet Project is committed to providing information in two ways: either through whitepapers developed by the members of the project after the investigation of our honeypots or through the translation to Spanish of content provided by other members of the Honeynet Alliance. The Spanish Honeynet Project has already translated most of the content of previous investigation and has coordinated it, within the framework of the <a href="http://his.sourceforge.net/trad/honeynet/">Honeynets in Spanish</a> project.</p>
<p>The Spanish Honeynet Project will also provide up-to-date information to Spanish most recognized technical magazines in the security arena, and will publish its findings through them to inform security professionals of its findings.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The Spanish Honeynet Project will help other interested organizations, such as technical universities, in developing their own ability to research threats or adversaries. It will also establish contact with IT security research departments in Spanish universities and other government organizations in order to deploy and maintain honeynet works outside the Project’s own network. This will provide additional information that will be analyzed by the project. Specific contacts will also be introduced with some technical organizations including Red.es (Antivirus alert network) and the AUI (Pepi-II Anti-Spam campaign) when researching service-oriented honeypots.</p>
